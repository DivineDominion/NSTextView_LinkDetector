# Link Detector

`NSTextView`s are super powerful, but setting them up to do syntax highlighting is very painful for the first time.

The resulting matches are clickable and, for the sake of doing something, attempt to open wiki links and hashtags in Notational Velocity/nvALT. So if you have nvALT installed, you can use this to navigate your note archive üòÅ
